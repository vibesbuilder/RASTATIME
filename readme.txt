      deployment (~8), audio (3), legacy-ui (~5). Total: ~55 files.
    - Confirmed clear: nginx (0), multiprocessing (false alarm), SIGHUP (0).
    - Pattern-based summary table updated with primary category column.

0.1.4 (2026-04-24)
    - Task T1.1 complete: docs/architecture/LINUX_INVENTORY.md created.
